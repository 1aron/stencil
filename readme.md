Protoype and mono-repo for `ionic-core`, `ionic-ui` and a demo app. Each project is already hooked up so theres no npm link BS do deal with for now.


## Initial Setup

    npm start


## Build All Projects

    npm run build


## Serve `demo/myapp/www`

    npm serve

http://localhost:8888/


Each project has its own package.json and can do it's own builds. Take a gander.
