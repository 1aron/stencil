Protoype and mono-repo for `ionic-core`, `ionic-ui` and a demo app. Each project is already hooked up so theres no npm link BS to deal with for now.


### Initial Setup

    npm start


### Build All Projects

    npm run build


### Serve `demo/myapp/www`

    npm run serve

[http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/)


Each project has its own `package.json` and can do it's own builds. Take a gander.
